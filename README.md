# Noir

A framework for writing clojure websites

## Usage

The best way to get started with noir is by downloading the lein noir plugin:

```bash
lein plugin install lein-noir 0.1.1
lein noir new my-website
cd my-website
lein run
```

Then simply open a browser up to http://localhost:8080/ and take it for a spin.

For an example of what a noir project looks like, check out the [noir-blog](https://github.com/ibdknox/Noir-blog) example project.

If you want to include Noir in an already created leiningen project, simply add this to your dependencies:

```Clojure
[noir "0.4.0"]
```

## Roadmap

* Full API docs
* Anotated examples of all public functions
